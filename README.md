<h2>üí° About the app</h2>
<p>This is a tool for the students of University of Tehran helping them pick courses for their future semester. The app enables students to see their weekly schedule beforehand and find timing interceptions between the courses they're thinking about selecting rather than finding them through trial and error during the actual selection period. Users can search between the courses that are being taught in the next semester by entering the title of the course or the name of the professor who teaches the subject. Then they can add the course to their planning board and see how it looks among their other choices and know whether there are any timing conflicts between what they've already picked.</p>
<h2>üìö Using it!</h2>
    <p>A live version is already deployed and ready to be used <a href="http://termup.iran.liara.run">here</a>. Keep in mind that TermUp only consists of a client-side webapp, therefore all of your data including the courses you've picked and your preferences are stored locally on your device. To be more specific the app stores this data on the local storage your browser allocates to the website. You can always get rid of this data by clearing the local storage of your browser.</p>
<h2>üë©‚Äçüíª Building the app</h2>
<p>Follow the steps below if you want to build the source code to either make changes for yourself or contribute to the project.
